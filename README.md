## Never Have I Ever by Angie Yu

#### https://github.com/angieyu232/never-have-i-ever

## Purpose Statement

As social animals, we all want to interact with other human beings and cultivating
friendships despite our physical distance. Sharing little details that are somewhat a secret about
ourselves is one of those things that can help continue our friendship remotely.

## Background Information

#### Audience/Users
Facebook or Twitter users. People who want to play games that are sociable and
it doesn’t cost a lot of time.

known alias in the result page, users that are not Facebook/Twitter users might be
reluctant to input their real name.
